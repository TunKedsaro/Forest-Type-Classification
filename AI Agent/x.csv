87,88,Normalized Difference 550/450 Plant pigment ratio,PPR,550nm-450nm550nm+450nm,3-13+1,Automatic,More,"The Plant Pigment Ratio (PPR) is a normalized index derived from Sentinel-2 imagery that quantifies the relative abundance of plant pigments. It is calculated from reflectance values in two narrow spectral bands centered at 550 nm and 450 nm. PPR values range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating a higher concentration of photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll and carotenoids. This index is particularly useful for monitoring vegetation health, as changes in PPR can be indicative of stress or disease conditions."

It is calculated using the reflectance values at 550nm (green) and 650nm (red) wavelengths. PVR measures the photosynthetic activity of vegetation, particularly the ratio of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to incident PAR. It is a proxy for plant health and vitality, with higher values indicating greater photosynthetic activity and plant productivity."
89,90,Normalized Difference 774/677,ND774/677,774nm-677nm774nm+677nm,7-47+4,Automatic,More,"The Normalized Difference 774/677 (ND774/677) is a vegetation index that quantifies the amount of green biomass in an area. It is calculated using the following formula:

ND774/677 = (Band 774 - Band 677) / (Band 774 + Band 677)

The index values range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating more green biomass. ND774/677 is particularly sensitive to changes in leaf area index (LAI), which is a measure of the amount of leaf area per unit of ground area. This makes it a useful tool for monitoring vegetation health and productivity."
